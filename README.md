## Companion App for Bitwig Studio that visualizes all notes from playing clips. 

this is a small companion app for Bitwig Studio that you can drag to any part of the screen, it stays active over Bitwig, and gives you a visual representation of the notes being played on every clip of your song.

### setup

- First you need to locate the Bitwig Studio controller folder and copy the "OverWigger" folder into there
- Then you need to run the version of the app for your platform ( you can find it in the zips inside the "build" folder)
- That's it, drag the app to the top of the screen so it doesn't block anything else, you're done!

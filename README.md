# OverWigger
## Tool for visualizing all playing notes from bitwig clips

This is a personal project, the idea behind this app is to have a visual representation of the notes being played on every clip of your song ( while you can look at the notes being played if you have open the touch keyboard, it only shows one track and the layout is different to a normal piano)

### setup

- First you need to locate the Bitwig Studio controller folder and copy the "OverWigger" folder into there
- Then you need to run the version of the app for your platform ( you can find it in the zips inside the "build" folder)
- That's it!
